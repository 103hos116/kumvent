Before contributing, please ensure you have ticked out these steps.

* Pull from the `main` branch.
* Create a branch using this format `your_name-feature_name`.
* Do your work locally & make as many commits as deemed necessary.
* Do not be hasty to use Flutter Plugins unless it is necessary.Too many plugins can have a
  negative impact on app size.
* When you are done & satisfied with your task, pull again from `main` to get the latest commit and
  fix any merge conflicts (if any).
* Do a code cleanup, refactoring, and final testing if all goes well.
* Finally, `push` your changes and create a `Pull Request`.

**NOTE: THIS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND REVIEW AS DEVELOPMENT GOES ON**
